# About the blog

I created this blog maily to track my progress as I learn the arts and crafts of Reverse Engineering. My plan is to post honest processes of going through a sample or a challenge with all the missteps and wandering in the dark that it takes when you are just starting out. Additionally, hopefully, just maybe it will help someone.
